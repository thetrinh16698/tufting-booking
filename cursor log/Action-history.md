# Tufting Booking System - Migration Action History

## 🎯 Project Goal
Migrate a Wix-dependent tufting booking system to a completely independent solution with no vendor lock-in.

## 📋 Actions Completed

### Phase 1: Analysis & Planning
- ✅ **Analyzed Wix Dependencies**
  - Identified 5 Wix packages: `@wix/bookings`, `@wix/members`, `@wix/pricing-plans`, `@wix/redirects`, `@wix/sdk`
  - Mapped Wix services: authentication, bookings, availability, pricing plans, service management
  - Created migration strategy with replacement solutions

### Phase 2: Infrastructure Setup
- ✅ **Installed New Dependencies**
  - NextAuth.js for authentication
  - Prisma ORM for database management
  - Stripe for payment processing
  - bcryptjs for password hashing
  - tsx for TypeScript execution

- ✅ **Created Database Schema**
  - Designed comprehensive Prisma schema with 8 models
  - User management (User, Account, Session, VerificationToken)
  - Business logic (Category, Service, Availability, Booking, Plan, Subscription)
  - Configured for SQLite development, PostgreSQL production ready

- ✅ **Set Up Authentication System**
  - NextAuth.js configuration with Google, GitHub, and credentials providers
  - JWT session strategy
  - Prisma adapter integration
  - Custom sign-in page creation

### Phase 3: Core System Development
- ✅ **Built Service Management System**
  - Created `app/lib/services.ts` with CRUD operations
  - API endpoints: `/api/services` and `/api/services/[slug]`
  - Service pages: `/services` and `/services/[slug]`

- ✅ **Developed Booking System**
  - Created `app/lib/bookings.ts` with availability and booking management
  - API endpoints: `/api/bookings` and `/api/availability`
  - Time slot generation and booking creation/cancellation

- ✅ **Created Database Utilities**
  - Prisma client configuration in `app/lib/db.ts`
  - Database seeding script with sample data
  - Generated 30 days of availability slots for 3 services

### Phase 4: Component Migration
- ✅ **Updated Layout System**
  - Replaced Wix session management with NextAuth.js
  - Created `Providers.tsx` for client-side context
  - Updated `layout.tsx` with new authentication flow

- ✅ **Migrated Authentication Components**
  - Replaced `Login.tsx` with NextAuth.js integration
  - Updated `NavBar.tsx` to use new session management
  - Created `/auth/signin` page with multiple provider options

- ✅ **Updated Service Components**
  - Modified `ServiceListPreview.tsx` to use new service structure
  - Replaced `WixMediaImage.tsx` with simple `MediaImage` component
  - Updated homepage to display tufting services

### Phase 5: Cleanup & Optimization
- ✅ **Removed All Wix Dependencies**
  - Deleted entire `app/model/` directory (Wix model layer)
  - Removed Wix auth hooks: `useClientAuthSession`, `useServerAuthSession`, `useMember`
  - Deleted Wix auth files: `wix-client.base.ts`, `wix-client.browser.ts`, `wix-client.server.ts`
  - Removed Wix auth routes: `/auth/callback`, `/auth/login-redirect`

- ✅ **Updated Middleware**
  - Replaced Wix middleware with NextAuth.js middleware
  - Configured route protection for `/account` and `/book-now`
  - Set up public routes for homepage and services

- ✅ **Fixed Import Paths**
  - Updated all API routes to use correct import paths
  - Fixed component imports to use new service structure
  - Resolved TypeScript compilation errors

### Phase 6: Testing & Validation
- ✅ **Database Setup & Seeding**
  - Created SQLite database with `prisma db push`
  - Seeded database with sample data (3 services, 2 categories, 2 pricing plans)
  - Generated 30 days of availability slots

- ✅ **Application Testing**
  - Verified homepage loads with tufting content
  - Confirmed services display correctly (3 services showing)
  - Tested authentication system (login/logout working)
  - Validated no Wix dependencies remain
